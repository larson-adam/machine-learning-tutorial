# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline with Hugging Face and Web App

This project is an **End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline** that uses a Hugging Face model for NLP tasks (like text classification or named entity recognition). It includes data preprocessing, model training (or fine-tuning), evaluation, and deployment to a web app. The project also explores the use of Docker for containerization and cloud deployment.

## Project Overview
We will:
- Preprocess data for training.
- Fine-tune a pre-trained Hugging Face model on a specific dataset.
- Build a web app with Flask/FastAPI to deploy the model and serve predictions.
- Deploy the app locally or on the cloud using Docker.

## Project Steps

### Day 1 (Beginner to Intermediate)

#### Morning
1. **Set Up Environment**
   - Install required libraries: `Transformers`, `scikit-learn`, `Flask` (or FastAPI).
   - Set up a Hugging Face account and explore available pre-trained models.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Choose a dataset (IMDb reviews or a dataset from Hugging Face's library).
   - Clean the data: tokenize, remove unnecessary characters, etc.
   - Split the data into training and test sets.

#### Afternoon
3. **Fine-Tune a Pre-Trained Hugging Face Model**
   - Select a model such as BERT or DistilBERT from Hugging Face.
   - Fine-tune the model on the dataset using Hugging Faceâ€™s `Trainer` API.
   - Evaluate the model's performance (accuracy, F1 score, etc.).
   - Save the fine-tuned model.

### Day 2 (Intermediate to Advanced)

#### Morning
4. **Model Deployment**
   - Create a web API using Flask (or FastAPI) to serve the fine-tuned model.
   - Write an endpoint to accept text input and return predictions (classification, sentiment, etc.).
   - Build a basic front-end interface for users to interact with the web app (HTML/CSS or React).

#### Afternoon
5. **Deploy the Web App**
   - Containerize the app using **Docker** to ensure portability.
   - Deploy locally or to the cloud (AWS, Heroku, etc.).

6. **Bonus Features**
   - Add explainability to the app using SHAP or LIME to show why the model predicted a certain result.
   - Include additional features like confidence scores and performance metrics on new data.

## Technologies Used
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For fine-tuning the NLP model.
- **scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and splitting.
- **Flask/FastAPI**: For building the API and serving the model.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the web app.
- **HTML/CSS/React**: For building a simple front-end interface.
- **AWS/Heroku**: For deploying the app (optional).
