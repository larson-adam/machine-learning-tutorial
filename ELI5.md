# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline with Hugging Face and Web App

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained **BERT** model for sentiment analysis using the Hugging Face library. It also shows how to use a public dataset and preprocess it for machine learning. We'll eventually deploy the fine-tuned model as a web app. This document explains everything we've done so far, including key concepts for those new to programming and machine learning.

## What is a Model?

In machine learning, a **model** is like a program that learns from data to make predictions or decisions. A model is trained on data and uses patterns it finds to solve tasks like classifying text, identifying images, or translating languages.

In this project, we are working with a **pre-trained model** from Hugging Face. Pre-trained models have already learned some general patterns from large amounts of data and can be fine-tuned (customized) for specific tasks, like sentiment analysis, where the goal is to understand whether text expresses positive or negative feelings.

## What is BERT?

**BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art model created by Google that is particularly good at understanding the context of words in text. It's widely used in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks, such as question answering, text classification, and named entity recognition. 

BERT has already been trained on massive datasets, so instead of training a model from scratch, we can fine-tune it for our specific task (sentiment analysis of movie reviews).

## What is a Dataset?

A **dataset** is a collection of data used for training and testing a machine learning model. In this project, we are using the **IMDb dataset**, which contains thousands of movie reviews. Each review is labeled as positive or negative, which makes this a good dataset for a **text classification** task (predicting whether a piece of text is positive or negative).

The dataset has two parts:
- **Training data**: Used to teach the model.
- **Test data**: Used to evaluate how well the model has learned.

## Steps Completed So Far

### Step 1: Set Up Environment

1. We set up a Python environment and installed the necessary libraries:
   - `transformers`: The library that provides pre-trained models like BERT.
   - `datasets`: The library that helps us load and manage datasets like IMDb.

2. We signed up for a Hugging Face account to access these models and datasets.

### Step 2: Load the BERT Model

We loaded a pre-trained **BERT** model and its **tokenizer** from Hugging Face. The **tokenizer** breaks down text into smaller parts called tokens (like words or subwords), which the model can understand.

The code to load the model:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

# Load the tokenizer and the BERT model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
```

- **Tokenizer**: Converts raw text into tokens that the model can process.
- **Model**: The BERT model itself, which will predict whether the movie review is positive or negative.

### Step 3: Load the IMDb Dataset

Next, we loaded the **IMDb movie review dataset** using Hugging Face’s `datasets` library. This dataset contains movie reviews along with labels (positive or negative), which will be used to train and test the BERT model.

The code to load the dataset:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the IMDb dataset
dataset = load_dataset("imdb")
```

- **Dataset**: A collection of data used to teach the model. In this case, the IMDb dataset contains movie reviews with positive or negative labels.

### Step 4: Preprocess the Data

We then tokenized the movie reviews to convert them into a format that BERT can understand. Since BERT works with tokens (subwords, words, or even characters), we need to break down the text into these tokens.

To do this, we created a function to apply the tokenizer to each review in the dataset:

```python
def preprocess_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples['text'], truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512)

tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)
```

- **Tokenization**: The process of breaking down the text into pieces that the model can process.
- **Truncation**: Cutting off text that is too long (BERT has a limit on how long the input can be).
- **Padding**: Adding extra spaces or tokens to shorter texts so that all inputs to the model are the same length.

By the end of this step, the dataset is ready to be fed into the model for training.

### What Happens Next?

In the next steps, we will:
1. Fine-tune the BERT model on the IMDb dataset.
2. Evaluate the model’s performance to see how well it predicts sentiment.
3. Save the fine-tuned model.
4. Build a simple web app to serve the model’s predictions.
5. Deploy the web app (possibly using Docker or cloud platforms).

## Concepts Recap

- **Model**: A machine learning program that makes predictions based on data.
- **BERT**: A powerful NLP model that understands text and its context.
- **Dataset**: A collection of data used to train or test a model.
- **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into small parts for the model to process.
- **Pre-trained Model**: A model that has already been trained on large amounts of data and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. If you are working in a virtual environment, run:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets
```
