# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline with Hugging Face and Web App

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained **BERT** model for sentiment analysis using the Hugging Face library. The tutorial walks you through key machine learning concepts, with annotations explaining important terms as they appear. We will be using the IMDb dataset for training and evaluation.

## Project Overview

We are fine-tuning a **BERT** model, pre-trained by Google, to classify movie reviews from the **IMDb dataset** as positive or negative. After fine-tuning, we will save and deploy the model as a web app for sentiment analysis.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install transformers datasets torch accelerate


	3.	Set Up Environment:
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows


	4.	Run the fine-tuning script:

python3 fine_tune_bert.py



Steps

1. Load Pre-trained BERT Model

We begin by loading the pre-trained BERT model using Hugging Face’s transformers library.

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

# Load the tokenizer and the BERT model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

Annotations:

	•	Model: A machine learning program that makes predictions based on input data. BERT is a powerful model for understanding text, and it has been pre-trained on vast amounts of data.
	•	Tokenizer: A tool that breaks down text into smaller units (tokens) so the model can understand and process it. BERT works with tokens, not raw text.

2. Load the IMDb Dataset

We load the IMDb dataset, which contains movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative. This dataset is commonly used for text classification tasks.

from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the IMDb dataset
dataset = load_dataset("imdb")

Annotations:

	•	Dataset: A collection of data used for training or testing a machine learning model. In this case, the dataset consists of movie reviews and their associated sentiment labels (positive/negative).

3. Preprocess the Dataset

Before feeding the data into BERT, we need to tokenize it, turning the movie reviews into a format the model can understand.

def preprocess_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples['text'], truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=512)

tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)

Annotations:

	•	Tokenization: The process of converting raw text into tokens (words, subwords) that the model can process.
	•	Padding and Truncation: Ensures that all inputs to the model are of the same length by either adding extra tokens (padding) or cutting off long texts (truncation).

4. Fine-Tune the Model

We now begin the fine-tuning process, which involves adapting the pre-trained BERT model to our specific task of sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset. We do this using Hugging Face’s Trainer API.

4.1 Define Training Arguments

Training arguments specify how the model will be fine-tuned. Here’s a breakdown of the key parameters:

from transformers import TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          # Directory to save model checkpoints
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",     # Evaluate after each epoch
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,   # Batch size during training
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,    # Batch size during evaluation
    num_train_epochs=3,              # Number of training epochs
    weight_decay=0.01,               # Weight decay to avoid overfitting
    logging_dir='./logs',            # Directory to save logs for monitoring
    logging_steps=500,               # Log metrics every 500 steps
)

TrainingArgument Parameters:

	•	output_dir: Where model checkpoints will be saved.
	•	evaluation_strategy: When to run evaluation (in this case, after every epoch).
	•	per_device_train_batch_size: The number of examples the model processes before updating the weights.
	•	per_device_eval_batch_size: Same as above, but for evaluation.
	•	num_train_epochs: How many times the model will pass through the entire dataset during training.
	•	weight_decay: A regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large model weights.
	•	logging_dir: Directory to save logs for tracking progress.
	•	logging_steps: The frequency of logging information about the training process (e.g., every 500 steps).

4.2 Create the Trainer Object

We use Hugging Face’s Trainer API to handle the training loop for us.

from transformers import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets['train'],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets['test']
)

Annotations:

	•	Trainer: A class provided by Hugging Face that abstracts much of the training process, including loss calculation, backpropagation, and evaluation.

4.3 Start Fine-Tuning

trainer.train()

As training progresses, you will see logs showing various metrics, such as loss, learning rate, and epoch progress. Here’s what they mean:

	•	Loss: A measure of how far the model’s predictions are from the actual labels. The lower the loss, the better the model is performing.
	•	Grad Norm: Represents the magnitude of gradient updates. Larger gradients suggest more significant changes to the model’s weights, while smaller gradients indicate finer adjustments.
	•	Learning Rate: Controls how much to change the model weights with each update. Smaller learning rates mean slower, more gradual learning.
	•	Epoch: Shows the progress through the dataset. An epoch is one complete pass through the training data.

Example output:

{'loss': 0.4277, 'grad_norm': 4.493, 'learning_rate': 4.73e-05, 'epoch': 0.16}

4.4 Save the Fine-Tuned Model

After training, we save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer.

model.save_pretrained("./fine-tuned-bert")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./fine-tuned-bert")

5. Evaluate the Model

After training, we evaluate the model on the test set to see how well it generalizes to new data.

results = trainer.evaluate()
print(results)

Annotations:

	•	Evaluation: The process of testing the model on unseen data to measure its performance.

6. Optimize for Hardware

To improve performance, Hugging Face provides the Accelerate library, which helps run models on multiple devices (CPU, GPU, etc.) and optimize training.

pip install accelerate

If you have a GPU available, you can modify the TrainingArguments to use it:

from torch import cuda

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    device="cuda" if cuda.is_available() else "cpu"  # Use GPU if available
)

Annotations:

	•	Accelerate: A Hugging Face library that optimizes model training by distributing the workload across multiple hardware devices.
	•	PyTorch: A deep learning framework that provides dynamic computation, allowing for more flexibility during training.

Conclusion

In this project, we’ve fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model using Hugging Face’s Trainer API and PyTorch. The tutorial covered important machine learning concepts such as forward pass, backpropagation, loss calculation, fine-tuning, and hardware optimization using Accelerate. With the fine-tuned model, we can now deploy it for real-world sentiment analysis tasks.
